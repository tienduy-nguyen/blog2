Object Oriented Programming Challenges.

<sub>_I'am learning and trying to improve my English. So I'm really sorry if my grammar mistakes annoy you. Thank you for your understanding._</sub>

## Kata challenges

After completed some challenges, I realise the more difficult to solve problem, it's is not only to find a solution. I need to find a better solution that is shorter, faster and easy to understand.

This week with THP, we start learning the the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby. OOP is a part very important that is a programming philosopy where we manipulate data as objects.

So, today I will take only the katas of this subject to improve my knowleages and my skills in this part.

### 1. Rot13 (5kyu)

The first challenge today is still handle string. There are too many string algorithms. Maybe in the next day, I will choose the challenges by subject. For example, I will learn the OOP soon. So I think I will choose the katas in this subject.

Now, we will go to solve the challenge.

:bell: Task: [Rot13](https://www.codewars.com/kata/530e15517bc88ac656000716/train/ruby)

> ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.

> Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".

For example

```
"grfg" == rot13("test")
"Grfg" == rot13("Test")
```

:arrow_right: My solution:

- It becomes more complicated with the 5kyu level. I take me more time to reach the best solution what I can.
- To do this challenge

```ruby
def rot13(str)
  lower=*(97..122)
  upper=*(65..90)
  str_ascii = str.bytes.map do |num|
    if lower.include?(num)
      (num-13) >= 97 ? (num-13) : (num-13+122-96)
    elsif upper.include?(num)
      (num-13) >= 65 ? (num-13) : (num-13+90-64)
    else
      num
    end
  end
  return str_ascii.map(&:chr).join
end
```

:heavy_check_mark: Best solution on codewars

```ruby
def rot13(string)
  string.tr("A-Za-z", "N-ZA-Mn-za-m")
end
```

```ruby
def rot13(string)
  origin = ('a'..'z').to_a.join + ('A'..'Z').to_a.join
  cipher = ('a'..'z').to_a.rotate(13).join + ('A'..'Z').to_a.rotate(13).join
  string.tr(origin, cipher)
end
```
