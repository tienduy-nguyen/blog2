Some tips you probably don't know in Ruby.

_I'am learning and trying to improve my English. So I'm really sorry if my grammar mistakes annoy you. Thank you for your understanding._

## Assigning the rest of an array to a variable

When destructuring an array, you can unpack and assign the remaining part of it to a variable using the rest pattern

```ruby
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b, *rest = *a

  b    # => 1
  rest # => [2, 3]
  a    # => [1, 2, 3]
```

## Word Array

When we want to add a seperator in the string

```ruby
%w{This is a string, I want to separate by a comma} * ", "
# "This, is, a, string,, I, want, to, separate, by, a, comma"
```

## Concate array

```ruby
[1, 2, 3] * 3 == [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] # true
new_array = Array.new([0], 5) # [0,0,0,0,0]
```

## Format decimal

```ruby
number = 9.5
"%.2f" % number # => "9.50"
number.round(2)
```

## Remove a folder

This is a relatively common job of developer. There a many different ways to delete a folder and this is one of the shortest and fastest way to do:

```ruby
require 'fileutils'
FileUtils.rm_r 'somedir'
```

## Massive Assignment

Massive assignement allow us to declare many variavles in the same time

```ruby
a,b,c,d = 1,2,3,4
```

This feature will be very usefull in the method with many parameters

```ruby
def my_method(*args)
  a,b,c,d = args
end
```

## Deep copy

When we copy an object that contains others objects inside, array for example, you only copy references to those objects

```ruby
food = %w( bread milk orange )
food.map(&:object_id)
=> [69612840, 69612820, 69612800]
[122] pry(main)> food.clone.map(&:object_id)
=> [69612840, 69612820, 69612800]
```

Using <code>Marshal</code> (usually use for [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)), you can create a deep copy.

```ruby
def deep_copy(obj)
  Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(obj))
end
```

See the result

```
ruby
ObjectSpace.each_object(String).select{|x| x == food.first}.count
=> 54
deep_copy(food).map &:object_id
=> [77564660, 77564420, 77564300]
ObjectSpace.each_object(String).select{|x| x == food.first}.count
=> 56

```

**Bonus**: Difference between <code>clone</code> and <code>dup</code>(They are almost the same, but there are two points that **dup** doesn't have)

- Clone also singleton class of copied object
- Keep the frozen state of copied object

For example

- Singleton methods
  ```ruby
  a = Object.new
  def a.foo; :foo end
  p a.foo
  => :foo
  b = a.dup
  p b.foo
  => undefined method `foo' for #<Object:0x007f8bc395ff00> (NoMethodError)
  c = a.clone
  c.foo
  => :foo
  ```
- Frozen state

  ```ruby
  a = Object.new
  a.freeze
  p a.frozen?
  => true
  b = a.dup
  p b.frozen?
  => false
  c = a.clone
  p c.frozen?
  => true
  ```

## The different ways to call lambda

```ruby
my_lambda = -> { puts 'Hello' }

my_lambda.call
my_lambda[]
my_lambda.()
my_lambda.===

```

## Create a an array with random values

```ruby
Array.new(10) { rand 300 }
```

It will create an array with 10 item that have the random values from 0 to 299
